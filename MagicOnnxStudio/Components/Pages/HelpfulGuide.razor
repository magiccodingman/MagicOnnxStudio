        <MudText Typo="Typo.body1" GutterBottom="true">
            When working with AI models, you may come across safetensor models, which are a modern, secure way to handle and use AI models.
            However, these models are typically designed to run in Python environments. The reason for this is that safetensors are structured
            to prioritize security and efficiency within Python-based frameworks, but they aren't fully optimized for direct use in other environments
            or production pipelines.

        <MudText Typo="Typo.body1" GutterBottom="true">
            Unlike safetensor models, ONNX models are more versatile and are becoming the standard for AI model deployment in production.
            ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models are effectively precompiled, which means they’re easier to integrate and run in a variety of
            environments beyond just Python. ONNX acts as a universal protocol, allowing AI models to be transferred between different platforms and systems
            smoothly, making them ideal for real-world applications.

        <MudText Typo="Typo.body1" GutterBottom="true">
            The application I’ve created is designed to simplify the process of converting safetensor models to ONNX format, making it easy for you to
            test the ONNX models you've converted. It’s tailored for production use, where ONNX shines. While my application focuses on ONNX, it’s worth
            mentioning that if you want to test safetensor models directly, there are already some excellent tools available for that.
